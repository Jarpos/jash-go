# jash-go - Just Another Shell Golang
A simple shell application, obviously inspired by
[Stephen Brennan](https://brennan.io/)'s
[Tutorial](https://brennan.io/2015/01/16/write-a-shell-in-c/).  
I have basically the same project, with the only difference being
that I'm trying to implement it in C++. This project is only
used for trying to learn Go myself and shouldn't be looked
at for any sort of advice on how to write code.

## todo
 - [ ] Add more builtin shell commands
    - [X] help
    - [X] exit
    - [X] mkdir
    - [X] mkfile
    - [X] ls
    - [X] cd
    - [X] cat
    - [X] find
    - [X] alias
 - [ ] Add option to launch applications from within shells using PATH or similar
 - [ ] Use GoLang Errors for handling errors
 - [ ] Add up/down arrow functionality for command history
 - [ ] Add parser for files that executes shell code
 - [ ] Extend feature set for existing shell commands
 - [ ] Add better error handling for existing shell commands
